            <p>By day, I am Software Quality Assurance Engineer fully employed with <a href="https://www.x1.com" target="_blank">X1 Discovery</a> where I manage the QA Team with testing our enterprise level solution. By night, twice a week, I am a TA for the "Websites for Beginners" course at <a href="https://bitwiseindustries.com" target="_blank">Bitwise Industries</a>. We teach the fundamentals of HTML5 and CSS3 to all students of various ages and backgrounds who are willing to learn.</p>
            <P>My passion for computers started in my early elementary school years, 1st grade to be exact. It started with the old Apple III computer that used the 5 1/4 in floppy drive. I was later introduced to the Macintosh SE which my school provided for the remainder of my elementary school years. Much later in my high school years, I was introduced to Windows 98 and XP operating systems, and in my senior year of high school, I learned the fundamentals of HTML4.</P>
            <p>During college, I never pursued a degree in Computer Science, but I did learn how to use different computers, operating systems, devices, software, and etc. on my own time. After College, I worked various jobs in various industries, and continued to learn the use of technology on my spare time.</p>
            <p>It wasn't until December of 2016 that I finally started my career in the technology industry when X1 Discovery hired me as a Tech Support Agent and was promoted to Software Quality Assurance Analyst six months later. It was during this time as a Software QA Analyst that I started to absorb a lot more knowledge and skills about the industry. Finally in February 2018, I was promoted to Software Quality Assurance Engineer, my current position, where I continue to learn and grow my knowledge and skills.</p>
            <p>My future career goals include becoming a great Quality Assurance Engineer. There is still much for me to learn as a QE. However, being a TA for Bitwise Industries has awoken an interest in pursuing Front End and Back End Web Development. Therefore, I will give myself that opportunity to become a student at Bitwise Industries and learn new skills under my belt to further advance my career.</p>
